# Rooms
Simple package for sharing streams in a presenter / viewers pattern.

Streams are transmitted from presenters to viewers.

Presenters can have multiple streams.

As new streams are added, they are automatically sent to all viewers.




Leave member open? Allow different types and the events can specify the type(s) to target.
e.g. viewer, presenter, source, etc.
